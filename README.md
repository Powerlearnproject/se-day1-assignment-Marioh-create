#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software engineering is a branch of computer science which applies engineering principles, methods and tools to create and maintain quality software systems. Software engineering is crucial in technology because it provides the methods and frameworks necessary for developing reliable, efficient, and secure software systems in communication, healthcare, teaching and other aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The birth of software engineering in 1968 - This milestone marked the beginning of software engineering as a formal discipline applying engineering principles in software development.

2. The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming in 1980s - Object Oriented Programming introduced key concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which helped in organizing software systems into modular and reusable components. OOP became a most preferred model in software development which then influenced several programming languages and software engineering practices. It also created a pathway for modern design patterns and methodologies.

3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies in 2001 -  Agile methodologies intensified iterative development, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.The primary principles included delivering working software frequently, welcoming changing requirements, and maintaining a sustainable pace of work.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - Identifying the project goals, determing the resources needed and having project timelines. It also includes having a list of what should be included in the software.
2. Design- Creating a software blueprint or a structure of how the software would look like.
3. Development- Building the actual software/ Coding stage.
4. Testing- Checking if software works correctly as intended for its users.
5. Deployment - Releasing the software to its users to interract with it.
6. Maintenance - Fixing bugs that may arise in the software and updating it to ensure the software runs smoothly without problems to its users. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- The Waterfall methodology is a Linear and Sequential method where you complete each phase of development one after the other. You move on to the next phase only when the previous one is finished. an example of waterfall methodology application is with medical software which is highly regulated, requirements are well defined and changes are expensive.On the other hand, the agile methodology is iterative and Incremental. The software is developed in small and manageable iterations or sprints. Each sprint includes planning, development, and testing. An example where agile methodology can be used is an android application where the user may give feedback on what needs to be changed.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer - The role and resposibility is to design, build, test, and maintain software applications.
- Quaity assurance engineer- His/her work is to ensure the software is of high quality, meet user needs and required standards before deployment.
- Project Manager - His/her work is to oversee the project from its initiation to completion factoring in goals, timelines and budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- IDEs provide an integrated environment that promotes productivity by offering code assistance, debugging tools, and project management features. Examples include Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA. On the other hand, VCSs manage and keep track of changes to the codebase, enable collaboration, support branching and merging, and offer rollback and recovery options. THe examples include Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Software engineers encounter challenges such as managing complexity, dealing with requirement changes, identifying and resolving bugs, managing technical debt, ensuring effective team communication, meeting deadlines, and keeping up with technology. Addressing these challenges involves adopting strategies like modular design, Agile practices, automated testing, regular code reviews, effective communication tools, realistic planning, and continuous learning. By implementing these strategies, software engineers can navigate through challenges and contribute to successful software development projects.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit Testing: It checks on small parts of the code to ensure correctness
- Integration Testing: It ensures the different part of the software integrate well or work together.
- System Testing: Tests the entire software application to make sure it works as intended.
- Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets the client needs and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- Prompt engineering is important for using AI models productively. It involves creating well-structured and specific prompts to guide the AI in giving accurate, relevant, and useful responses. By enhancing prompt design, users can improve the performance of AI models, streamline interactions, and attain better results in several applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-  Vague Prompt: Tell me about climate change.
-  Improved Prompt: Explain the main causes of climate change and their effects on global temperatures. Include recent statistics and the impact on coastal cities.

The improved prompt is more effective because it clearly defines the topic, specifies what information is needed, and sets additional criteria for the response. This approach reduces ambiguity, helps the AI understand the exact requirements, and increases the likelihood of receiving a detailed and useful response.
